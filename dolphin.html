                        <p class="text-[#94A3B8]">Evolutionary Journey: The Ganges river dolphin represents one of the most ancient lineages of cetaceans, having adapted to freshwater environments millions of years ago. They belong to the river dolphin superfamily, which diverged from oceanic dolphins approximately 30 million years ago. Their evolution in the murky waters of South Asian rivers led to the complete loss of functional vision, making them essentially blind and dependent entirely on echolocation for navigation and hunting.
Scientific Discovery and Classification: Although the Ganges dolphin is mentioned in mythological and historical literature, its occurrence in the Hooghly River was first documented in 1801 by William Roxburgh, Superintendent of the Botanical Garden, Calcutta. Lebeck's type description is based on an adult male specimen collected in November 1797 from close to Calcutta, India, and it is thought that this is the same material that Roxburgh based his description on. The species has undergone significant taxonomic revision over the centuries, with various scientists proposing different classifications. The current scientific consensus recognizes it as Platanista gangetica, distinct from its cousin the Indus river dolphin.
Cultural and Historical Significance: The Ganges river dolphin holds profound cultural and spiritual significance in Indian civilization, intertwined with the sacred nature of the Ganges River itself.
Religious and Mythological Importance: National Recognition: Recognized by the Government of India as its National Aquatic Animal and is the official animal of the Indian city of Guwahati. Sacred Waters: Associated with the holy Ganges River, considered sacred in Hindu tradition. Ancient Sanskrit Texts: Referenced as "Shishúmára" in Vedic literature. River Goddess Connection: Linked to Ganga Devi, the river goddess in Hindu mythology. Spiritual Symbolism: Represents the pure essence of sacred rivers and divine flow.
Cultural Legacy: Folk Names: Known as "Susu" onomatopoeically for the sound they make while breathing. Traditional Knowledge: Local fishing communities have observed and coexisted with these dolphins for millennia. Regional Identity: Symbol of riverine culture in Bengal, Bihar, and Assam. Conservation Icon: Became flagship species for Ganges River conservation efforts.
Historical Timeline: Ancient Period: Referenced in Sanskrit literature and local folklore. 1797: First specimen collected near Calcutta. 1801: Scientific documentation by William Roxburgh and description by Lebeck. 1830: Genus name Platanista coined by Johann Georg Wagler. 1972: Listed in Schedule I of India's Wildlife Protection Act. 2009: Declared National Aquatic Animal of India. Present: Population critically reduced to fewer than 2,000 individuals.
Modern Conservation Recognition: The species has become a symbol of India's commitment to freshwater ecosystem conservation and serves as an indicator species for the health of the Ganges River system, one of the world's most important river basins supporting over 400 million people.</p>

                        <h4 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Poaching Incidents and Threats</h4>
                        <p class="text-[#94A3B8]">Current Conservation Status: The Ganges river dolphin is classified as Endangered by the IUCN. Once present in tens of thousands of numbers, the Ganges river dolphin has dwindled abysmally to less than 2000 during the last century owing to direct killing, habitat fragmentation by dams and barrages and indiscriminate fishing.
Poaching and Direct Killing: Despite legal protection, the species faces multiple forms of direct human persecution: Traditional Uses and Illegal Trade: Entanglement in fishing nets as bycatch can cause significant damage to local populations, and individuals are taken each year by hunters; their oil and meat are used as a liniment, as an aphrodisiac, and as bait. Historical and Current Killing: Oil Extraction: Dolphin oil traditionally used for medicinal purposes and as lamp fuel. Fishing Bait: Meat used as bait for catfish, particularly valuable for large fish. Traditional Medicine: Body parts used in folk remedies despite no scientific basis. Accidental Killing: Many deaths occur through fishing net entanglement.
Systematic Threats and Modern Challenges: Habitat Fragmentation: The Gangetic dolphin faces several threats including dam and barrage construction, water pollution, overfishing and motorised transport. Dolphins trapped above a dam are exposed to poaching, especially during dry summer months. Dolphins below a dam are threatened by heavy pollution, increased fishing activities.
Environmental Degradation: Water Pollution: Chemical runoff, sewage, and industrial waste affecting water quality. Sand Mining: Illegal sand mining is increasing the danger for Gangetic dolphins according to senior scientist at the Zoological Survey of India. Reduced Water Flow: Over-extraction for irrigation and industrial use. Noise Pollution: Motorboat traffic interfering with echolocation.
Fishing-Related Mortality: The threats include poaching, by-catches, decline in prey fishes largely driven by human population explosion, decrease in depths of the rivers and consequent increases in fishing pressures.
Regional Threat Assessment: Ganges Main Stem: Heavy pollution, dam construction, intensive fishing. Brahmaputra System: Habitat fragmentation, declining fish populations. Chambal River: Relatively better conservation but still facing poaching pressure. Tributaries: Severe habitat degradation, local extinctions in many smaller rivers.
Legal Protection: Protected under Schedule I of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. Killing and poaching are cognizable offenses, with offenders facing fines up to $500 US and/or 7-year imprisonment.</p>
